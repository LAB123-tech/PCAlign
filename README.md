# Python implement of paper "PCAlign A General Data Augmentation Framework for Point Clouds"

This project is A python implementation of the paper "PCAlign A General Data Augmentation Framework for Point Clouds", and the original warehouse can be referred to https://github.com/vvvwo/PCA-based-Point-Cloud-Alignment/tree/main which is implement by c++.

To improve the understanding of the idea of PCAlign while minimizing distractions from extraneous code, we choose to directly employ PointNet as the backbone network.

Feel free to replace PointNet with a powerful backbone network to achieve optimal performance across various point cloud tasks.
